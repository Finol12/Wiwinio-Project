# Vivinio Project

This group project is a part of **AI Bootcamp** at [<\/becode>](https://becode.org/)

 
## Description

### Mission Objectives

A learning challenge, **Wiwinio Project** targetted to acquire and consolidate knowledge in the following subjects:

- SQL and Databases
- Data Analysis
- Data Analysis deployment using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) and/or [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)


### Data

A sample database ([SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)), reflecting the assortiment, ratings, and sales information for the Belgian market, from the wine selling website ([Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/BE/en/)) was provided.

#### Database structure

### Questions to be answered

The team had to answer several questions, like...

1. Highlight 10 wines to increase the sales. Which ones should be choosen and why?
2. With the marketing budget for this year, which country should be prioritzed and why?
3. Analyse the special tastes and their combinations.
4. Select top 5 wines produced from the most popular grapes.
5. Create a country leaderboard based on the wines ratings and popularity.


## Analysis

The analysis is done and saved in Jypiter Notebooks.

Here are some plots to illustrate some findings:

### Top wines by Country
